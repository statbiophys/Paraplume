This is the folder where we we used Paragraph to analyze data.
- Paragraph was trained on 1000 structures from the whole expanded dataset of Paragraph, with early stopping done on a vlidation set of 86 structures to stop training before over-fitting. Training and validation sets are available in `benchmark/datasets/paragraph_all_expanded`.
- All analyses on antibody repertoires (figures 4-5) were done in `repertoire_analysis`. The `repertoire_analysis/briney` folder contains sequences and germlines with paratope predictions (files starting with `paratope`) from the healthy human donor 316188 of this [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0879-y). The `repertoire_analysis/hifibio&naive_mice` folder contains all sequences and germlines along with paratope predictions for the immunized mouse repertoire, sorted for binding to tetanos toxin by HiFiBiO in 2020 ([paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340288245_High-throughput_single-cell_activity-based_screening_and_sequencing_of_antibodies_using_droplet_microfluidics)), as well as for the naive mouse repertoire ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31428692/)). The `repertoire_analysis/philipps` folder contains all paratope predictions for the Deep Mutational Scan on a broadly neutralizing antibody of this [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34491198/).
- Work on sequence representation (figure 6) was done in the `data_with_scripts/sequence_representation` subfolder. Comparisons of the unweighted and paratope weighted were done for affinity, binder classification, epitope binning and expression in the corresponding subfolders.
- Study of the paratope asymmetry (figure3, including data curation needed for the study) is done in folder `data_with_scripts/paratope_asymmetry`.
- Use of the paratope asymmetry to compute an upper bound of sequence-based paratope prediction methods (table3) was done in folder `data_with_scripts/paratope_limits`.
- Speed and CO2 emissions comparisons were done in `data_with_scripts/speed_tests`
- Paratope inference was done using `benchmark/paraplume_requirements.txt`. All other analyses, including figures, were done under `data_with_scripts/analysis.txt`
- Code for all figures is available in `data_with_scripts/figure_notebooks`
